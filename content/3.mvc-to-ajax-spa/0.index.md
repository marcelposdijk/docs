# MVC to Ajax SPA

## Introduction

We are looking into the possibility to upgrade a legacy Admin Portal application to a more modern template, and in the same time make it a SPA.

This is how the project currently looks:

We can only spend a couple of weeks on this project, so we had to be really pragmatic.

In doing some ressearch online, I came a across a Bootstrap 5 admin template [Color Admin](https://seantheme.com/color-admin/admin/ajax/) that looks pretty decent and using Ajax to load the content, thus making it a good candidate for our upgrade project.
