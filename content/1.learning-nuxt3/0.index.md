# Introduction

I've been working on upgrading my skills as a webdeveloper for around a week now. Off and on because I have to make some money doing my regular day job as an independent fullstack developer.

I am pretty experienced in Nuxt2 and I am happy with the functionality and developer experience. 
I have been using the options API but would like to experiment with the composition API and all the "new" Vue3 features.

So far, it has been quite the journey. A lot of things are different and it's like I'm having to relearn and unlearn a lot of things.
Not everything was straightforward and easy, but hey, that's the world of a software developer!

## My starting point

Since I'm not a very good designer and css and I are not best friends, I decided to get myself a headstart, and spent a little money on a Vue3 template: [Gull](https://themeforest.net/item/gull-vuejs-admin-dashboard-template/24497287).

It is my plan to create a Nuxt3 app from scratch and step-by-step convert the Vue3 theme to Nuxt3. 

The theme is built using [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/) so I'll be using this time to learn this framework too. Who knows, I might become a real frontend designer!

For the tailwind specific experience check out this [page](/tailwind)

I'm documenting my progress in a brand new Nuxt3 / Content2 website that is based on a the free template [Docus](https://docus.dev).
