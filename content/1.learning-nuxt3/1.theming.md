# Theming

My main challenge a developer is to create a site that is visually appealing. I'm not particularly great at CSS, although I understand the basic concepts.
In the process of getting to know Nuxt3, I'm also trying to figure out a way to understand css and the avaialble css frameworks more.

## Using ColorMode

Almost every modern site has a **dark mode** avaiable. More and more people prefer to view content in that way, even up to to 80%.
Tailwind has built-in dark mode support. Just add the class "dark" to the html tag and it will work nicely.

When user loads our site for the first time, we'd like to set the mode to the value of the users' system.
Also, we'd like the user be able to change the color mode and we want that preference to be saved so that when he refreshed the page, the colormode is applied.
Thankfully, we there is a nice component that we can use to achieve this: [ColorMode](https://color-mode.nuxtjs.org/).

Install it via:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @nuxtjs/color-mode
```

Update the nuxt.config by adding the module an setting the classSuffix to ''.

```js
import { defineNuxtConfig } from 'nuxt'
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['@nuxtjs/color-mode'],
  colorMode: {
    classSuffix: ''
  }
})
```

In your layout page change it to the following:


```vue
<script setup>
const colorMode = useColorMode()
const htmlAttrs = computed(() => {
    return { class: colorMode.value }
})
useHead({
    htmlAttrs
})
</script>
```

Then in the header you can create a function that switches the color"

```vue
<script setup>

const colorMode = useColorMode()
const isDarkMode = computed(() => {
  return colorMode.value == 'dark'
})
const switchColorMode = () => {
    colorMode.preference = isDarkMode.value ? 'light' : 'dark'
}

</script>

<template>
  <div><slot/></div>
</template>

```
