# Issues

There have been a number of frustrating issues that took me a lot of time to solve. But hey, I've become a better developer now :smiley:

##  Installation Pinia

To install @pinia/@nuxt use the following command, otherwise the pinia library will not be installed amd the nuxt app will not start.


```bash
npm install pinia @pinia/nuxt @nuxtjs/composition-api --legacy-peer-deps
```
